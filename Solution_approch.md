## Approach

### Data Processing
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Used for ingredient similarity comparison.
- **Normalization**: Applied MinMaxScaler to normalize numerical features like ratings, cooking time, and nutritional values.
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoded recipe categories.

### Recommendation Algorithm
- Weighted similarity calculation:
  - Ingredient similarity: **60%**
  - Rating similarity: **20%**
  - Nutritional similarity: **10%**
  - Category similarity: **10%**
- Filtering capabilities for dietary restrictions and cooking time.

### User Interface
- Built with **Streamlit** for interactivity.
- Search functionality:
  - By recipe name.
  - By ingredients.
  - Browsing recipes.
- Card-based layout for recipe display, including:
  - Detailed nutritional information.
  - Step-by-step cooking instructions.

## Challenges and Solutions

### State Management
- **Challenge**: Recipe details not updating when selecting new recipes.
- **Solution**: Implemented session state management and containers for proper content updates.

### Data Normalization
- **Challenge**: Normalized values (0-1) displayed instead of actual measurements.
- **Solution**: Retained both normalized and original values, using normalized data for calculations while displaying original values.

### Search Functionality
- **Challenge**: Search results not dynamically updating.
- **Solution**: Added state handling and rerun triggers for seamless search updates.

### Performance
- **Challenge**: Slow loading times for large datasets.
- **Solution**: Implemented caching for data loading and optimized similarity calculations.
